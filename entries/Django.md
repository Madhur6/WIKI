Django is a web framework written using [Python](/wiki/Python) that allows for the design of web applications that generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML) dynamically.

Django is a powerful and versatile web development framework built on top of Python. It offers a seamless and efficient way to create web applications, simplifying the entire development process with its "batteries-included" approach. Django's robust architecture allows developers to focus on writing clean and maintainable code, making it an ideal choice for projects of all sizes.



One of the key strengths of Django is its built-in support for handling common web development tasks, such as URL routing, database management, and user authentication. Developers can effortlessly define URL patterns and views, allowing users to interact with different parts of the application through a well-structured and intuitive interface.



Moreover, Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system provides a convenient and abstracted way to interact with the database. By using Python classes and objects to represent database models, developers can perform database operations without writing complex SQL queries, promoting code readability and maintainability.
